"""
Trade simulation engine.

Takes a strategy's entry/exit signals and turns them into a sequence
of Trades, applying execution realism (commission, slippage, forced
intraday close, and optional risk management). This is intentionally
the ONLY place that understands "what does it mean to hold a
position" — strategies just emit signals.

Kept here (not inside Strategy subclasses) so every strategy gets
identical execution behavior, and improvements to fill/commission/risk
modeling benefit every strategy at once.
